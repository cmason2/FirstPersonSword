This dungeon has multiple levels, each filled with different enemies and challenges to overcome.
Use the WASD keys to navigate forward, backwards, left and right. A mouse/trackpad is used to look around.

The player will awaken in a dark room inhabited by a terrifying monster. The player must evade the monster and locate three keys with the help of a torch to proceed further into the dungeon.
The second room is littered with sharp spikes that will damage the player on contact. The player must battle their way through a number of enemies to reach a switch that will remove the obstruction blocking the exit door.
The player's final challenge takes place in the dungeon boss's lair. The player must use their wits to take down the boss and secure their freedom.
